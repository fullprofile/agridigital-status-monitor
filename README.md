# AgriDigital Status Monitor

This repository contains the open-source uptime monitor and status page for [AgriDigital](https://app.agridigital.io), powered by [Upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime).
[üìà AgriDigital Status Monitor](https://fullprofile.github.io/agridigital-status-monitor) provides a quick look at our Agridigital services and the uptime of each service. It is a public status monitor website. It shows Agridigital websites' live status, incident history, and response time graphs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to create a status monitor page and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
**See Issue & Banner for notes on creating notices on status monitor page.**

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push

- [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
- Slack Channel

### Development

#### Create a repository from the template

- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository - GitHub - upptime/upptime: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Free uptime monitor and status page powered by GitHub
- Above the file list, click Use this template.
- Use the Owner drop-down menu, and select the account you want to own the repository.
- Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.
- Choose a repository visibility as Public
- Important: Check "Include all branches"
- Click Create repository from template
- Your status page will be hosted on https://<user>.github.io/<repo> where user is your GitHub username and repo is your repository name.

#### Enable Publishing in Github

- Go to your repository settings page
- Go to the "Pages" sub-section on the left
- Under "Source", change "None" to gh-pages
- In the folder dropdown, select /(root)

- In the left sidebar, click "Secrets"
- Press the button "New repository secret"
- Enter the name of the secret as GH_PAT
- Paste your personal access token into the Value field

#### Create custom name in Route53 in AWS

#### Update Configuration in repo

- Verify owner (organization or username, where this repository lives) and repo ( name of this repository) in in .upptimerc.yml configuration file.
- Enter the endpoints you want to monitor in .upptimerc.yml configuration file.
- You can start by adding your endpoints under sites:
- To use a custom domain, remove the line starting with baseUrl: and instead add your custom domain name in cname:
- To customise the page follow configuration mentioned in Configuration | Upptime
- Push your changes to master repository

#### Enable HTTPS in Github Pages

- Go to your repository settings page
- Go to the "Pages" sub-section on the left
- Check the box for Enforce HTTPS
- Click on "Save"

#### Add Slack notification

- Create slack channel for tracking status for agridigital status monitor
- Create slack app and a slack webhook URL. See the article https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/115005265063-Incoming-webhooks-for-Slack for Slack on the Slack website.
- Create additional environment variables in Repository secrets
  NOTIFICATION_SLACK Set to true
  NOTIFICATION_SLACK_WEBHOOK Set to true
  NOTIFICATION_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL Slack webhook URL

### Deployment

A step by step to track sites/endpoints in status monitor page

Clone Repository

    git clone https://github.com/fullprofile/agridigital-status-monitor.git

- Open in Visual Studio
- Open .upptimerc.yml file. The .upptimerc.yml file is used as the central configuration for Upptime, with this syntax
- After you've created a new repository using this template, specify the username and repository name in the configuration
- You can track as many websites as you like. Add the names and URLs of your endpoints in the sites key

```
sites:

  - name: Google
    url: https://www.google.com
  - name: DuckDuckGo
    url: https://duckduckgo.com
```

- Maximum response time - Upptime endpoints can be up, down, or degraded. By default, if an endpoint takes more than 30 seconds to respond, its performance is tracked as "degraded". You can customize the maximum response time. In the below example, this endpoint will be measured as degraded if it takes more than 5 seconds to respond.
```
  - name: Slow endpoint
    url: https://example.com
    maxResponseTime: 5000
```
- Custom domain: To use a custom domain, add the cname key
```
  status-website:
  name: Upptime
  logoUrl: https://example.com/image.jpg
  cname: status.agridigital.io # Custom CNAME
```
- See detailed configuration settings in https://upptime.js.org/docs/configuration

### How it works

- GitHub Actions is used as an uptime monitor
- Every 5 minutes, a workflow visits your website to make sure it's up
- Response time is recorded every 6 hours and committed to git
- Graphs of response time are generated every day
- GitHub Issues is used for incident reports
- An issue is opened if an endpoint is down
- Incidents reports are posted as issue comments
- Issues are closed automatically when your site comes back up
- Slack notifications are sent on updates
